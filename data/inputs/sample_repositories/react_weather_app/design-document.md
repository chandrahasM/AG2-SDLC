}
```

## User Stories

1. **As a user, I want to see current weather for my location**
   - Given I am on the weather app
   - When I enter a location
   - Then I should see current weather data for that location

2. **As a user, I want to search for different locations**
   - Given I am on the weather app
   - When I type in the search box
   - Then I should see search suggestions
   - And I should be able to select a location

3. **As a user, I want to see weather details**
   - Given I have searched for a location
   - When the weather data loads
   - Then I should see temperature, condition, humidity, and wind speed
