## Document Information
- **Document Type**: Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Created Date**: January 2024
- **Last Updated**: January 2024
- **Status**: Ready for Development
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a 7-day weather forecast feature in the existing React Weather App. The feature will extend the current single-day weather display to provide users with a comprehensive weekly weather outlook, enabling better planning and decision-making.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Users currently can only view current weather conditions for a single day, limiting their ability to plan ahead for the week. This creates a gap in the user experience where users need to repeatedly search for the same location to get future weather information.

### Business Objectives
- **Increase User Engagement**: Provide more comprehensive weather information to keep users on the app longer
- **Improve User Experience**: Enable users to plan their week with detailed weather forecasts
- **Competitive Advantage**: Match or exceed features offered by other weather applications
- **User Retention**: Reduce the need for users to visit other weather services

### Success Metrics
- **User Engagement**: 40% increase in average session duration
- **Feature Adoption**: 70% of users interact with forecast feature within first week
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.5+ star rating for forecast accuracy
- **Retention**: 25% improvement in 7-day user retention
