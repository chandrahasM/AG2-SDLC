## Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Location Input**
   - Users can enter a city name in a search input field
   - Support for international city names
   - Input validation and error handling
   - Search suggestions or autocomplete (future enhancement)

2. **Weather Data Display**
   - Current temperature in Celsius
   - Weather description (e.g., "Partly Cloudy", "Rainy")
   - "Feels like" temperature
   - Humidity percentage
   - Wind speed in km/h
   - Atmospheric pressure in hPa
   - Visibility in kilometers
   - Weather icon representation

3. **User Interface**
   - Clean, modern design with Tailwind CSS
   - Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
   - Dynamic background colors based on weather conditions
   - Loading states during API calls
   - Error handling and user feedback
   - Animated elements for enhanced UX

4. **Data Integration**
   - Integration with Open-Meteo API (free, no API key required)
   - Real-time weather data retrieval
   - Geocoding support for city name to coordinates conversion
   - Global weather data coverage
   - Error handling for API failures

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Stack

### Performance Requirements
- Initial page load under 3 seconds
- Weather data fetch under 2 seconds
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Optimized images and assets

### API Requirements
- Open-Meteo Weather API (free, no API key required)
- Open-Meteo Geocoding API (free, no API key required)
- No rate limiting for basic usage
- Global weather data coverage
- Real-time weather updates

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Usability
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface
- Clear visual feedback for all user actions
- Accessible design following WCAG guidelines
- Error messages should be clear and actionable

### Security
- No API keys required (Open-Meteo is free)
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- HTTPS-only communication with APIs
- Client-side only application

### Maintainability
- Clean, well-documented code
- Modular component structure
- TypeScript for type safety
- Consistent coding standards

### Scalability
- Component-based architecture for easy feature additions
- Service layer abstraction for API calls
- Configurable API endpoints

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories
1. **As a user**, I want to search for weather by city name so that I can quickly get current weather information for any location.

2. **As a user**, I want to see detailed weather information including temperature, humidity, and wind speed so that I can make informed decisions about my day.

3. **As a user**, I want the app to work on my mobile device so that I can check weather on the go.

4. **As a user**, I want visual feedback when the app is loading data so that I know the system is working.

5. **As a user**, I want clear error messages when something goes wrong so that I understand what happened and what to do next.

### Future Enhancements
1. **As a user**, I want to save my favorite cities so that I can quickly access weather for frequently checked locations.

2. **As a user**, I want to see a 5-day weather forecast so that I can plan ahead.

3. **As a user**, I want the app to detect my current location so that I can get weather without typing.

4. **As a user**, I want to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit so that I can use my preferred temperature unit.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Search Functionality
- ✅ User can enter a city name and press Enter or click search button
- ✅ App validates input and shows error for empty searches
- ✅ App handles invalid city names gracefully
- ✅ Search results display within 2 seconds

### Weather Display
- ✅ All required weather data points are displayed clearly
- ✅ Weather icons are appropriate and load correctly
- ✅ Temperature is displayed prominently
- ✅ Additional details are organized and readable

### User Experience
- ✅ App is fully responsive on mobile and desktop
- ✅ Loading states are shown during API calls
- ✅ Error messages are clear and helpful
- ✅ Animations enhance but don't interfere with functionality

### Technical

## Dependencies
- Node.js 18+ for development
- Modern web browser for testing
- Internet connection for API calls
- No external API accounts required

## Constraints
- Client-side only (no backend required)
- No API key required (Open-Meteo is completely free)
- Single page application (SPA) architecture
- Real-time weather data only (no historical data)
